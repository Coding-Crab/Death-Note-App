            <li>
                The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
            </li>
            <li>
                This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
            </li>
            <li>
                After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The Death Note will not take effect if:
                The person writing the name is not the original owner of the Death Note.
                The name is written by a person with the intention of saving the person.
                The name is written by someone who is unable to see the person's face.
            </li>
            <li>
                The person possessing the Death Note can extend their own life by writing their own name in the note along with the method of prolonging their life.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a Death Note is lost or destroyed, the person whose name was written in it will not die.
            </li>
            <li>
                If multiple Death Notes exist and a name is written in two or more of them, the death will occur according to the first Death Note in which the name was written.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a person other than the original owner of the Death Note touches it, that person will be unable to see the names of those who will die of a heart attack, unless the original owner writes the person's name in the Death Note. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If a Death Note is left unused for more than 13 days, it will become useless.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a person uses a Death Note, their lifespan will be shortened by the number of people whose names they have written in the note. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If a person possesses a Death Note, they are able to see a Shinigami (Death God), but only the owner of the Death Note can talk to the Shinigami.
